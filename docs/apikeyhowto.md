# How to create a Kalshi API key

1. Go to kalshi.com
2. Click the hamburger `â˜°` in the upper right
3. Click `Account & security`
4. Scroll down and click `Create key`
5. Give it a name, like *AnvilTrader*
6. Click `Create`
7. Copy the private key, including the ---BEGIN--- and ---END--- parts, and save it in a secure place, like your password manager.

AnvilTrader will ask for the key ID and the private key. The key ID can be found on the kalshi.com Account & Security page. Kalshi doesn't store the private key so it's up to you to keep track of it yourself.

N.B. You may have noticed after step 6 that Kalshi automatically downloaded the private key to your machine. It'll be in your Downloads folder. This is similar in sensitivity to a password so once you have saved it some place secure, I recommend
deleting this file. No need to leave it sitting out in the relative open.
